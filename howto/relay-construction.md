Building relays

    The local B&amp;Q
</div>
When your journey through some idyllic country village is marred by the
sight of some junkyard of rotting agricultural machinery and
disintegrating hardware, has it ever occurred to you that this is not evidence of rustic
sloth but a valuable resource?  When the nearest source of hardware is
two hours away you have to learn to improvise.  If, in the middle 
middle of some project, you have to get a bit of sheet metal or some
nuts and bolts, you cannot nip out to a local hardware to get them.
You scour the local junk piles for what you need.  In fact a local
handyman will have a keen knowledge of what can be found where and how
it can be adapted.


It was during one such prowl round the local fish-farm junk-yard (fish
farms have really high-quality junk) that
I discovered the wonder-material for mast construction: aluminium
scaffold tubing. It's light, it's strong, it doesn't rust, it's easy
to cut, and it can be bolted together with standard scaffold couplers to
make incredibly rigid structures.  It can be bought new for about
\pounds5 per metre, but it's possible to get used stock from scaffold
erectors -- maybe slightly bent or cut to odd lengths -- for a much
lower price. 4 people can easily carry a mast up a hillside in one go.

The other revelation that happened after we had put up our first relay
was that they do not have to be tall sticky-up things.  Whoever
created Scotland provided it with an abundance of tall sticky-up
things. All one has to do is to build relatively low structures, on the
side of one of those sticky-up things, that puts the antennae above
the heads of livestock and inquitistive hikers.  The normal
structure we use has a horizontal bar 3-4m long so that antennae can
be mounted with reasonable separation. The best thing is to show a few
pictures, but first a few notes.

 * Cut some 1m lengths of tubing to use as pegs that can be driven into
   the ground with a sledgehammer. There's usually no need for concrete,
    and the fact that it is pegged in makes it a "temporary" structure
    that may be useful in getting permission to put one up.

* Use tubing rather than wire for diagonal stays and bracing; it is
   much more rigid.

* Don't stint on the tubing; you may need 30m for a relay. Get
  plenty of couplers, both swivel and rigid (right-angle).


* It's often easier to align antennae by rotating the tubing within
  the couplers rather than using the fiddly mechanisms that come with
  some antennae.

* However inapplicable health and safety regulations are, do wear a
hardhat.  A piece of scaffold falling from a height of a metre on to
your head can do a lot of damage.

  Note the "Knoydart variation" of two horizontal bars. Probably a
  good idea if there are very strong winds.
