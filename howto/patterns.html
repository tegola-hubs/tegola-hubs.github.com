<h1>Link Patterns</h1>

<p>
  There are some choices to make when building a link between
  two sites. The main tradeoff is simplicity vs. flexibility,
  where to put the intelligence in the network.
</p>
<p>
  Often wireless equipment as provided by a vendor such
  as <a href="http://ubnt.net/">Ubiquiti Networks</a> is very
  good in terms of simply forwarding packets and easy to set up
  but is rather limited in terms of what it can do in a larger,
  more complex network, especially when there may be multiple
  paths to a particular destination since it doesn't support any
  form of dynamic routing, for example. It is possible to run
  firmware from a third-party such
  as <a href="http://openwrt.org/">OpenWRT</a>, however it may
  be more complicated to get set up properly and some parts of
  the hardware may not work as well as with the official vendor
  firmware. Proprietary protocols from the vendor may not work
  at all, and whilst it is generally a bad idea to use them
  because we are not allowed to know how they work or what they
  do -- which can make debugging difficult or impossible -- and
  they can get us caught by
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">vendor
  lock-in</a>, sometimes it is necessary to use them when
  connecting to a network run by somebody else.
</p>
<p>
  What follows are various patterns that we have deployed in
  different scenarios, with some discussion about where it is
  appropriate to use which and how the simplicity
  vs. flexibility tradeoff is met by each. Throughout the
  assumption is that all links are some kind of ethernet, be it
  wireless or copper wire or optical media.

<h2 id="bridging">Bridging vs. Routing</h2>

<p>
  The usual way of explaining the difference between routing and
  bridging is with reference to
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">OSI
  model</a>. In simple terms, routing is what happens at the
  network layer (3) and bridging is what might happen at the
  data-link layer (2). Though the OSI model is an important
  conceptual tool, real networking stacks do not map exactly
  onto it. This explanation won't use it.
</p>

<h3>Bridging</h3>
<p>
  The first thing to understand is that all ethernet interfaces
  are supposed to have a unique address, called a MAC
  address. These are 48-bit numbers whose allocation is
  centralised, with blocks of addresses being handed out to
  different hardware vendors. It is possible to change the MAC
  address of an interface in software but in practice this is
  not usually done except in certain very unusual situations.
</p>
<p>
  An important thing to remember about MAC addresses is that
  they are basically unique randomish numbers. They bear no
  relationship to the structure of the network. Their only
  purpose is to enable computers that are directly connected to
  each other to exchange data.
</p>
<p>
  An ethernet frame, in addition to some checksums and other
  housekeeping, has a source and destination MAC address. If an
  ethernet interface receives a packet for a MAC address that
  doesn't belong to it, it is supposed to ignore it.  There are
  some special of MAC addresses, perhaps the most important is
  the broadcast address <code>ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff</code> or
  all-ones. This is used for messages that are meant to be heard
  by all hosts on the local network. There are also other
  MAC address ranges reserved for a related purpose, to support
  multicast, where some but not all hosts on a local network are
  meant to receive the ethernet frames.
</p>
<p>
  Early forms of ethernet such as 10base5 (thicknet)
  10base2 (coax) and 10baseT (twisted pair) were true shared
  communications media. Either by nature as with coax or by
  using a hub, the same electrical signal sent by one host was
  seen by all others on the local network. This meant that there
  was the possibility of two hosts sending a signal at the same
  time and because these signals would be electrically added the
  other hosts would not receive anything intelligeable. This is
  called a collision. The hardware had a collision-detection
  mechanism which at least made it possible for the sending host
  to find out that this had happened and retransmit, but on busy
  networks all of these retransmissions had a seriously bad
  effect on performance.
</p>
<p>
  The solution to this was to make things that behaved more or
  less the same way as hubs, but incorporated more intelligence,
  storing and then forwarding ethernet frames instead of just
  repeating the electrical signal. In addition, rather than
  forwarding frames out every port save the one they are
  received on, switches (for that is what these devices are
  called) will learn which addresses are attached to which port
  and only send frames out that one (broadcast and multicast
  frames being, of course, sent out all or several ports as the
  case may be). This arrangement is a huge improvement over dumb
  hubs and today even inexpensive switches can sustain traffic
  levels in the several Gbps range quite happily.
</p>
<p>
  A switch and a bridge perform exactly the same function,
  storing and forwarding of ethernet frames, and keeping track
  of which MAC addresses are reachable by which port. The
  difference is that in a switch every port is of the same type
  (or possibly closely related types such as 100Mbit ethernet
  and gigabit ethernet differing only in line rate) whereas a
  bridge will typically have a heterogeneous collection of
  ports. For example it is quite possible to have a bridge with
  a regular ethernet port, a wireless ethernet port, a
  tunnel interface over the Internet, and an ATM/DSL
  interface. It may not make sense to construct such a thing,
  but there is no reason why it couldn't be done.
</p>
<p>
  A very common kind of bridge is essentially a slightly
  intelligent media converter. This type, with two ports, an
  ethernet interface on one side and a wireless on the other, is
  the most used in wireless and community networking projects.
</p>
<h3>Routing</h3>
<p>
  Ethernet and bridging and such are concerned with local
  networks. This is a somewhat specialised meaning of the word
  "local". It can be understood like this. Suppose there are two
  hosts. If they are connected with an ethernet cable, they are
  obviously local to one another. In particular each can have
  all of the information that is needed (the MAC addresses) to
  talk to the other. Suppose that this cable is replaced with a
  really long and complicated series of switches and
  bridges. Provided everything is functioning correctly, host A
  and B still need no more information than with the simple
  cable in order to communicate. Even though they may be
  physically on the other side of the world from each other,
  they are still local in this sense.
</p>
<p>
  It is not the case that all networks and all network links are
  ethernet. Especially in the past it was common to make
  long-haul links using things like frame-relay, or ATM or even
  dial-up telephone lines running protocols like PPP and
  SLIP. It is also not the case that the hardware MAC addresses
  are typically used for logical addressing -- if you change
  hardware on a server, you don't want to have to reconfigure
  all of the clients to use a different address to reach it.  As
  well, if every host in the world, or even a moderately sized
  organisation, were connected to the same local network it
  would be trivially easy to overwhealm the network with
  broadcast traffic.
</p>
<p>
  For these and other reasons we have a system of coordinated
  logical network addresses, in modern times Internet Protocol
  (IP) addresses, either version 4 or 6. Each local network uses
  some bit of address space and each host maintains the
  necessary information to communicate with its local
  neighbours. In addition each host maintains one or more routes
  that say some other network is reachable via a particular one
  of its neighbours. By managing this routing information
  carefully it is possible for each host to keep only the
  minimum amount of information required to reach every other
  host in the world and it is further possible to arrange so
  that if the structure of the network changes, say a link goes
  down or is added, communication can continue with only a
  momentary disruption. There is much more to say on this
  topic.
</p>
<h4>IP Addresses</h4>
<p>
  IP addresses are just numbers. IPv4 addresses are 32 bits in
  size and IPv6 addresses 128 bits. The space of all addresses
  is divided using netmasks. A netmask is a number the same size
  as an IP address, but starting with some number of ones
  followed by some number of zeros. The number of ones in a
  netmask is called the prefix length.
</p>
<p>
  Take, for example, the IP address <code>192.0.2.1</code>. The
  dots conveniently separate bytes (8 bits) of the number. This
  is therefore the same number as <code>3221225985</code> in
  decimal notation or <code>0xc0000201</code> in hexadecimal. If
  we say that whichever network this address is in has a netmask
  of <code>255.255.255.240</code>
  or <code>11111111111111111111111111110000</code> in binary or
  equivalently a prefix length of 28 this means that the final
  four bits in the address are allowed to vary for this
  network. In other words the network
  covers <code>192.0.2.0</code>
  through <code>192.0.2.15</code>. Any address outside this
  range is in a different local network, which need not bear any
  physical or topological relationship
  to <code>192.0.2.0/28</code> no matter how similar such an
  outside address may look.
</p>
<p>
  Networks can contain other networks and this can be checked
  using the netmasks. For example, <code>192.0.2.0/24</code>
  contains <code>192.0.2.0/28</code>. On the basis of the prefix
  length, larger prefix lengths are said to be more specific
  than smaller ones. Indeed there is one
  network, <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>, which contains all others.
</p>
<p>
  A route is a pair <code>(network, nexthop)</code> where the
  network is as above and the next hop is information about how
  to reach this network through a locally reachable
  neighbour. When there is a choice to be made about where to
  send a packet, the destination is checked in a table of such
  routes to see if it is contained in each network. If there are
  multiple matches the most specific one, the one with the
  largest prefix length is chosen. This is the basic IP
  forwarding algorithm that is executed at each host and router
  on the Internet for each packet that crosses it.
</p>
<p>
  Considering equipment that is readily available, such as
  wireless gear from Ubiquiti or other vendors, everything up to
  this point is within the capabilities. It can either be
  configured as a bridge or as a router, and if done as a router
  the IP forwarding algorithm can be run. But, for most
  inexpensive equipment with vendor firmware, this is the limit.
  Beyond this limit, and a very important question for a network
  of any significant size is how routes become known to all
  routers that must know about them. Even in the absence of
  redundant links or cycles or loops in the network topology it
  can quickly become unweildy to manually set all the necessary
  routes in each host or gateway.
</p>
<h3>Dynamic Routing</h3>
<p>
  Dynamic routing is a way to automatically populate the routing
  tables throughout a network. There are several different
  protocols, RIP, OSPF, OLSR, BGP and so forth for doing this,
  each with strengths and weaknesses and there are scenarios
  where it is appropriate to use one or the other. The details
  of this are for another text, suffice it to say that they
  exist and there are many different implementations of most of
  these that interoperate well enough
</p>
<p>
  The thing is, though, that the equipment that is normally used
  with dynamic routing is rather more expensive than the couple
  of hundred pounds one might spend on a decent wireless
  device. Thankfully there are free implementations of these
  protocols that will run, with third-party firmware on
  them. There is still a cost. Firstly, running third-party
  firmware means that the equipment is slightly less "off-the
  shelf". Secondly these protocols need to be configured
  correctly with some understanding of what they are
  doing. Whereas entering many static routes might be tedious
  and error prone, an error in that case means that a particular
  subnet might become unreachable. On the other hand an error in
  configuring dynamic routing can easily cause a more
  generalised outage. It makes sense, therefore, to keep the
  number of nodes running a dynamic routing protocol to the
  minimum necessary.
</p>
<p>
  One scenario that is not handled at all by static routes is
  when there are multiple paths that might reasonably be taken
  across the network. A choice has to be made about which path
  to use and this choice might vary in time. For example there
  might be a primary link with large capacity that is normally
  used but if it develops a fault a second link should be used
  to maintain some, perhaps degraded, connectivity. Because
  static routes are, by their very nature, static, this kind of
  reactive change is not possible. Networks made entirely with
  static routes are brittle for this reason.
</p>
<h2 id="pops">Kinds of Sites</h2>
<p>
  In any network there will naturally be several different kinds
  of sites. There will be central or core sites with lots of
  links to other places and often some upstream bandwidth
  available. These typically will have few, if any, end-user
  connections. There will also be edge sites which is where the
  end-user connections are. In between there will be
  distribution or relay sites whose function is to connect the
  two. Ideally, distribution sites should maintain links to at
  least two core sites, whilst edge sites normally have only one
  link. Core sites should also be connected together, ideally
  directly, without non-core intermediaries. Distribution sites
  may be connected to other distribution sites if convenient.
</p>
<p>
  Our core sites are generally made up of:
  <ul>
    <li>A router with only ethernet interfaces running BSD or
    Linux</li>
    <li>A switch whose function is to increase the effective
    number of ports on the router (making use of 802.1q
    VLANs)</li>
    <li>Whatever equipment is appropriate to construct links to
    other sites, connected to the switch</li>
  </ul>
  At some particularly important sites this setup is duplicated
  with redundant routers and switches with outward links spread
  over both switches as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  At these sites the intelligence (i.e. participation in dynamic
  routing protocols) is concentrated in the core router and the
  configuration of the other equipment is deliberately kept as
  simple as possible.
</p>
<p>
  Our distribution sites are generally in places where the
  electricity supply is limited and so we are constrained to use
  the minimum amount of equipment. Some sites, for example, are
  solar powered at the tops of mountains. Because of this
  constraint, and also because of remoteness (if one piece of
  equipment fails, anything not directly affected should
  continue functioning, as replacement or repair can be delayed
  due to the physical circumstances), the intelligence is spread
  around with more of the equipment doing dynamic routing. Each
  of these routers, which will typically have only one ethernet
  and only one wireless port, is connected to a low-power
  switch.
</p>
<p>
  The edge is just that, typically some home or office computers
  connected to a router with only a default gateway and no
  participation in dynamic routing.
</p>
<h2 id="ptp">Point to Point Links</h2>
<p>
  The first case is connecting two core sites, say with a
  wireless link. Each has a router that speaks regular wired
  ethernet. The physical layout is going to involve an
  ethernet-wireless device with one ethernet interface and an
  antenna at either end. The ethernet will be connected to a
  port on the router (likely via the switch) in both
  cases.
</p>
<p>
  These ethernet-wireless devices could also do dynamic
  routing. But what would be the benefit? Their job is to take
  packets from one of their interfaces and send them out the
  other. There is not much choice for them. Making them into
  fully fledged routers wouldn't gain anything. In fact making
  them into dumb routers, with static routes, would be even
  worse because they would need complete information about what
  networks lie in either direction to make their routing
  decisions. No, best to make them simple bridges, basically
  media converters, and then the core routers on either side can
  act as though they are directly connected, local to each other
  on that interface.
</p>
<p>
  This arrangement is,
<pre>
+--------+   +--------+             +--------+   +--------+
| router |---| bridge |--< radio >--| bridge |---| router |
+--------+   +--------+             +--------+   +--------+
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  The next case is where a distribution site is connected to a
  core site. At the distribution site every device is already
  set up as a router. As these are typically the exact same
  equipment as was used as a bridge above, and only have one
  ethernet port, it would require a strange contortion to try to
  connect them somehow in the above way. If the switch were
  connected via a bridge to the core router, the core router
  would then have to maintain adjacencies with each distribution
  router, and it is quite possible that packets between edge
  hosts get hairpinned along the backbone link to the core
  router unnecessarily.
</p>
<p>
  For the same reasons as above, however, we don't want the
  media converter at the core site to participate in the routing
  protocol. Fortunately, there is nothing wrong with an
  asymmetric setup of a router talking to a bridge, and in these
  scenarios the following arrangement is used,
<pre>
+--------+   +--------+             +--------+
| router |---| bridge |--< radio >--| router |--- distribution switch
+--------+   +--------+             +--------+
</pre>
</p>
<p>
  The final scenario for point-to-point links, which may by now
  be obvious, is connecting two distribution sites. This is
  simply two routers connected directly with their radio
  interfaces. They are truly directly connected and there is
  nothing special going on here:
<pre>
+--------+             +--------+
| router |--< radio >--| router |
+--------+             +--------+
</pre>
</p>
<h2 id="ptmp">Point to Multipoint Links</h2>
<p>
  Considered at the physical level, all of the above
  point-to-point links, where they are radio links, will use
  highly directional antennae, usually parabolic dishes. These
  focus the transmission so that more radio frequency energy is
  directed where it needs to be and little is wasted going in
  the wrong direction.
</p>
<p>
  A distribution system by contrast is meant to provide service
  to many edge sites. These edge sites are not likely to be
  neatly lined up in the area covered by a very narrow beam, so
  at the distribution sites antennae with a wider beam pattern
  are used. There are a variety of sectoral or panel antennae on
  the market for this purpose.
</p>
<p>
  Whereas the distribution antenna needs a view of many edge
  sites, any particular edge site only needs to be able to see
  the distribution antenna, so here a highly directional antenna
  will give best results. The pattern then, is to have many
  dishes at the edge sites aimed at a sectoral antenna at the
  distribution sites.
</p>
<p>
  Keeping the equipment at the edge as simple as possible, it
  needs to do routing to a certain extent in order to separate
  truly local traffic such as network file sharing and the like
  from the wide area, but it doesn't need complete
  information. There is only one way out, and the next hop, the
  distribution site, has enough information to make the decision
  of where to send packets from there. This is well within the
  capabilities of most equipment on the market, indeed it is
  what most every home DSL router does.
</p>
<p>
  This works so far as figuring out what to do with packets from
  an edge network to elsewhere goes, but what of packets in the
  reverse direction? The edge router, or cpe ("customer premises
  equipment") might know about what networks it is directly
  connected to, but since it doesn't participate in the dynamic
  routing protocol, how is this information communicated
  upstream? This is the place for static routes. For each edge
  network, a static route is put in the appropriate distribution
  router, and it then communicates the information to the rest
  of the network using the dynamic routing protocol. This is
  manageable because each static route must only be put in one
  place, and there is only one possible path that can be taken
  for that last hop.
</p>
<h2 id="addressing">Addressing Considerations</h2>
<p>
  There are some ramifications for IP address allocation for the
  various ways of configuring point-to-point links. In the last
  case, two routers talking directly to each other, a small
  network, a <code>/30</code> is typically used. This is the
  smallest possible network, permitting only two hosts (yes, two
  bits means four addresses are available, but only two are
  useable because in normal circumstances the top one will be
  used as a broadcast address and the bottom is reserved as a
  network address for historical reasons).
</p>
<p>
  When a bridge is involved, even though the bridge might not be
  forwarding packets at the IP layer, it is useful to give it an
  IP address so that it can be managed -- usually with a web or
  command-line interface. There are two strategies. The first is
  to make the network dedicated to that link larger. The next
  larger network is a <code>/29</code> with six useable
  addresses. Given that there will be a maximum of four devices
  on the link in the above scenarios, this means two wasted
  addresses, or 33% wastage. In an era of scarce IP addresses
  this can add up quickly, which may not be as important if
  private RFC1918 addresses are used throughout the network.
</p>
<p>
  There are some good reasons for not using private addresses
  generally in the network, particularly if it is at all
  possible that it will be connected to another similar network
  in the future. If private addresses are used, either address
  translation has to happen at the border, which breaks some
  programs that people want to use and is generally counter to
  the end-to-end principle that underpins the success of the
  Internet, or one network has to renumber which can be quite
  painful and tedious.
</p>
<p>
  The alternative is to use private addresses for management of
  the bridges, visible only within a particular administrative
  domain. This is reasonable because these devices are not in
  any way intended to communicate with the outside world. They
  must simply do their job, and connectivity for network
  management purposes must be maintained.
</p>
<h2>Next...</h2>
<p>
  The sequel will look in more detail at dynamic routing
  protocols and how they work and will pay special attention to
  what is necessary to connect two different networks run and
  administered by different organisations.
