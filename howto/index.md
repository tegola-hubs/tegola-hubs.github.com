These pages are intended to help people construct their own wireless
distribution networks.  If your broadband connection to the telephone
exchange goes over more than 1km of copper, then you are probably
better off with a wireless link.  If it's more than 5km, the chances
are that broadband will be miserably slow or not work at all; in which
case wireless is definitely better.  Of course, it would be even
better if someone would replace the copper with fibre, but that is
expensive and fraught with bureaucratic obstacles. In the next few
years, wireless networks are going to be the only viable option for
many rural communities.  Moreover they are cheap to build; and the
technology is rapidly improving and delivering faster speeds.

The first thing to say is that how you deploy wireless depends on all
sorts of factors, there is no standard solution; but for people who
are new to wireless networks we thought to start with the simplest
possible scenario -- just to illustrate how simple it is.  

You live in an idyllic cottage at the head of Glenbogle.  Perfect peace;
a beautiful garden; spectacular views; but no broadband.  The 
telephone line is very old and comes all the way from Inverbogle
by a rather circuitous route.  Inverbogle is a prosperous town, and
the exchange has been upgraded to ADSL2+. There's even talk of
deploying fibre through the town. Your friend Morag, who has a house
in Inverbogle reports that she is reliably getting 17Mb/s on a connection
that her service provider -- as is their habit -- advertised at
20Mb/s.  At any rate, it's more than enough for Morag, and since her
children have all left home, she is quite happy to share her
connection with you.

On a clear day, you get out your telescope and find that you can see
-- all the way down Glenbogle to Morag's house -- about 5 miles away,
What do you do?  You buy two of these (insert link to nanostations) or
maybe two of these (insert link to nanobridges).  You mount them on
your and Morag's roof tops pointing at each other.  You connect the
one on Morag's roof with a thin ethernet cable to Morag's ADSL
modem. You connect the one on your roof directly to your computer (or
maybe to a wireless router in your house).  You configure the two
boxes (it's very easy) through a simple Web interface, and that's it!

The total cost if you do this yourself is probably about £200, a bit
more if you employ an sparkie to make the cables and climb around
on your roof. Given that you are now sharing the cost  of Morag's
broadband connection, and paying her £100 a year - half the cost of 
her connection, the equipment has paid for itself in two years; and
Morag is also saving money.

There are certainly people for whom this is the answer.  However, for
most of us it's more complicated.  The major issues are:

* You cannot see Morag's house, and it's 20 miles away so you need to
  build one or more intermediate relays.

* You are not alone in Glebogle, but live in a small village, and
while Morag is happy to put a small transmitter on her roof, she's
not sharing her internet connection with 50 people.

Note that we have not listed "you don't have a friend such as Morag"
as an obstacle.  In our experience, there is always a "Morag", though sometimes
it is a helpful institution or company rather than an individual.
