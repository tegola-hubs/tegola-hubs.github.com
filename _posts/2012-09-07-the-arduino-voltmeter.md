When testing the [Long Link to Eigg], we ran into a problem with the
solar powered mast at Coille Mhialairigh. Whenever we put any
particular load on the network there, the switch at the mast would
reboot -- even if the traffic itself didn't touch the switch. The
suspicion is that the extra load on the power supply causes the
voltage to drop outwith the tolerance of the little netgear switch.

Testing this hypothesis is not easy, however. It might involve a lot
of sitting in the cold on top of a hill with a voltmeter while the
problem is reproduced. Much better to try to arrange to be able to do
it from the comfort of the house, by the warm fire.

Recently at the [EMF Camp] we were given badges that contained little
boards with [Arduino] micro-controllers on-board. These are
fantastically flexible tiny computers, intended primarily for artists
making electronic scuptures, and for use in the classroom to help
teach basic electronics, and of course for hobbyists who put them to
all sorts of uses.

In this case the task is pretty simple -- measure the power supply
voltage which, in practice will be the same supply that powers the
Arduino board itself. This is done by using an analogue input pin on
the board. It has six, but we only need one. These pins allow to read
a voltage in the 0-5V range, which is turned into a number between 0
and 1023. 

The power supply cannot be directly plugged into the analogue input
because it runs at 12V and would burn out the pin. So a simple voltage
divider circuit is used:

The resistors, R1 and R2 are chosen so that they are in a ratio of
more or less 3:1. This means that, roughly the input can range from
0-20V and by tapping in between the resistors it will have been
reduced by Â¾ and what is measured on the A0 pin will be in the
correct range.

The actual voltage is [reconstructed] like so:

<span>
\[
V^{+} = \frac{5}{1024} \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_2}
\]
</span>

The chosen values are, \\(R_1 = 680 k\Omega\\), \\(R_2 = 220
k\Omega\\). This corresponds at 12V to a current of \\(13 \mu A\\)
(cf. [Ohm's Law][O]) -- meaning measuring the voltage won't appreciably
drain the batteries. Of course this needs to be added to the couple of
hundred milliamperes that the board itself will draw.

To make it convenient to retrieve the readings, the [Arduino Ethernet
Shield] is used, together with the [Webduino] library. The [entire
program] is a tiny 162 lines of code, including comments and blank
lines.

It does two things:

* Interrupt every second and take a new voltage reading, add the
  reading to a circular buffer.
* Upon receiving an HTTP GET request, serve up the contents of the
  buffer as a JSON document.

The reason for the circular buffer is so that the readings can be
stored while the faulty switch is rebooting and read out afterwards
without losing any data.

Now to head back up North and install it and see what we find!
