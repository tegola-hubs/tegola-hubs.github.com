[Marwan] and I went out to the [University of West Scotland] in
[Hamilton] to see about putting a radio up on one of their buildings
to connect a small and relatively sparse community near [Allanton].

The proposed setup in this case is somewhat simpler than the networks
out on the West coast, being simply a [Nanostation M5] at the
university, which has a nice wide radiation pattern and then several
rather more directional [Nanobridge M5] out in the field.  This was
just an exploratory trip, so everything was done in a very temporary
manner, the Nanostation strapped to a 2m length of 40mm plumbing and
wedged behind a filing cabinet, and the Nanobridges mounted atop a
similar length tube.

After spending the morning with Brian Mullins, head of ICT at UWS
explaining what we proposed to do and putting up the temporary radio
next door to the Campus Director's office, we headed out to Allanton
with Anne Graham and Hew Colquhoun to see if we could see the signal
after a nice lunch.

The initial results were somewhat disappointing, however. Only from
outside of Hew's house were we able to get a link, and even then the
signal was very weak, too close to the noise floor to really be
useable. On the bright side, there were very little other signals in
the 5GHz band that we could see, and none on the particular channel
that we had chosen randomly in advance.

There are several things to try next. Obviously the arrangement at the
University is very temporary and far from ideal. The best thing would
be to mount it on the roof. It might be that the glass in the windows
is interfering with the signals as some kinds of glass treatments are
known to do this. It is also possible, even likely, that we misjudged
the vertical angle of the antenna there and it actually is aimed too
far downwards. This last is the easiest thing to change, so obviously
the first thing to try -- simply adjust the ad-hoc mounting.

If that fails, and this may be a good idea in any event, use a radio
with a better antenna, such as the [Rocket M5] with a [90̣° sector] --
these are the ones we use up North.

The final possibility is, there is a church about mid-way between the
school and Allanton, and it is visible from pretty much the whole
area. It may well be possible to use it as a relay site.

We'll have another go next week...
