title: Redundant Power in Knoydart
---

Attached a couple of photos of the latest set-up.

The UPS set up is a Studer XPC 1400-12 inverter/charger with two Yuasa ENL100-12FT batteries attached in series. There is a changeover switch and generator input(no generator although we could find one). There is an easy option(blue plugs) of bypassing the inverter/charger if there happens to be a problem. This whole thing has taken a lot of time and some confusion but think the end result is good(if anything a bit over the top) and should easy last a whole night given the demand at the top of the hill. There was a power down for maintenance on Sat and there was no down time at the top of the hill.

The dish with the radome is the original that points to Mallaig. The green box came from the original Bridge broadband set-up. Bit of work to do on the platform although the steel at the back takes most of the weight. The ground is a pig here so will have to build up in solid.

Final picture shows green box at transformer site before getting installed. Transformer is at the end of the power line hence the need to put in pretty hefty protection. Transformer is about 250m from the road at glaschoille. The dish site is 600m further up the hill. Mobile reception at top mast – but not 20m from it. A help might be a HomePlug connector between the bottom and top of the hill. With a cable into the switch at the top this would allow alternative access without going up the hill. On sunday – during some work at the bottom – the top all seemed to disassociate. Sector wouldn’t show up on a site survey so I had to make the assumption that it had powered off. It hadn’t - was just playing a wee waiting game but still. A phone call from the top to Simon and a wee fiddle about helped to solve!

UPS(APC 700va ES-8) have also been installed at three relay points so the system should not need the round of re-setting we currently have to do on a power maintenance day.
