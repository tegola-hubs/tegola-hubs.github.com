title: Community Broadband Meeting -- Preliminary Report
author: Peter Buneman
---

The organisers of the meeting felt that the event was very successful,
and hope it will continue to contribute to the Community Broadband
Initiative. We were impressed by the breadth, energy, and diversity of
community engagement.  It illustrated the dynamism of community
projects; and we must not lose this momentum.  Over 100 people
attended, representing more than 20 communities who have built, are
building or are considering building their own network infrastructure.

One participant, [@cyberdoyle] tweeted, "it was scottish government and
communities getting together to share knowledge, celebrate and it was
mindblowingly awesome, and buzzing with great ideas."

A big thank you to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig Ostaig for organising the meeting and to
Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, the University of Edinburgh and Scottish Government
for funding it.

This site www.tegola.org.uk is intended to help these groups start to
work together and help each other and others.  We will soon be putting
up a Wiki so that communities can keep in touch and continue to help
each other.

In the meantime please post impressions, suggestions and contributions
