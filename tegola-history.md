A Brief History of the Tegola Project
=====================================

The Tegola project started in 2007 when three of us, academics from the
[University of Edinburgh] decided to start up a research project on the
delivery of low-cost, reliable and high speed broadband in rural areas.  It is
entirely uncoincidental that one of us has a
house in a remote village that was then without broadband.

In November 2007, together with some colleagues, we erected a wireless
link from [Isleornsay] to [Corran], a distance of about 10 miles, and for
one glorious weekend, thanks to a resident of Isle Ornsay who let us
use his Internet connection, brought broadband to a couple of houses
in Arnisdale and Corran.  Alas, we could not keep that connection, and
at that time the Scottish Government was unwilling to help us obtain
one that would serve the community.

Fortunately, because it was a research project, we were able -- thanks
to help from the [University of the Highlands and Islands] (UHI) and from 
[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig] -- to obtain a connection to the
Internet via the academic network [Janet].  Although this was great
for our research because Janet could offer much higher speeds than
anything that was available to domestic consumers, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig
is not in an ideal position.  It is further away from Corran (over 13
miles) and there is no line-of-sight for wireless transmission.  In
fact the lowest point that can "see" both Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and Corran
is over 300m up the side of [Beinn Sgritheall], and not an easy walk.
Amazingly, one afternoon in very early January 2008, a group of about eight
residents of Arnisdale and Corran, all somewhat the worse for wear
from [Hogmanay] celebrations turned out and, in the space of a few hours,
climbed the hill and erected our first relay.  It was then that we
realised the importance of community involvement to the project.

By the summer of 2008 we had completed the research testbed, a ring of
five relays, and a number of research projects were started as
described on our [research pages].  We also "borrowed" a number of
retired desktop PCs from our department, the [School of Informatics], and gave them to
members of the community.  This turned out to be by far the best way
of getting people of all ages to use the internet.  The younger
members, especially the children,  needed no instruction and taught the oldies.
In addition to research, we gained a huge amount of practical
experience in building networks that is described on our [howto pages].

Tegola was frequently in the
news, it had substantial press coverage and it was one of the stimuli
for the Royal Society of Edinburgh's Digital Scotland report;  though
it failed to make any immediate impact on Scottish Government
policy. Please see the [Tegola news] pages for some of the more
interesting publicity.


The next major event took place  in the spring of 2010, 
when we were approached by Simon
Helliwell on [Eigg]. The people on Eigg had been frustrated by various
attempts to get satellite connections from companies that went
belly-up.  Although the latest offering,  heavily
subsidised  by the Scottish Government, looked as though it would be more
stable, the performance was so bad that they turned to us for help. 
We lent them some equipment and rapidly erected a test link, which
performed perfectly. We had hoped that, just as Tegola was
getting its connection through an educational network, that Eigg could
get its connection through another educational network, [Pathfinder],
through [Mallaig High School].
Unfortunately [Highland Council], which one might think would show more
commitment than universities to local communities, did
not see it this way, and the Small Isles had to make do with a bunch of BT lines
in Arisaig -- not nearly as good as what Tegola was getting, but much
better than their satellite connection.  For more detail on this see
the [Hebnet] Web site and a presentation on the [history of Hebnet].


By the middle of 2011 it was clear that we could  no longer use our
research
projects as the sole reason for providing long-term backhaul to what was now a
successful network upon which the community relied.  We either had to formalise our
arrangement with Janet or, like Hebnet, fall back on relatively slow
BT lines, which would be a pity because our networks are capable of
delivering speeds that are well above the best domestic speeds that
are available in the UK.

Then there were a number of happy coincidences. First, JANET started
to modify its policies to give Universities more freedom in what they
could do with their Internet connections; second UHI said that it
would be willing to provide backhaul for us on a permanent basis; and
third Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, which had always been very supportive and
helpful, gave us a “wall” on which we could mount antennae. The catch
was that we would have to pay UHI for backhaul bandwidth; in that part
of the world, bandwidth is not cheap, and [State Aid] rules mean that
the University cannot provide a cheap connection which would undermine
any future commercial providers. Fortunately [Marine Harvest], a company
with at least two stations in the general Tegola/HebNet region stepped
in as a commercial customer of HebNet which means that the cost can be
afforded. This is an ideal example of industry-community
collaboration: each side needs the other. We are now combining the
Tegola and HebNet networks, together with South Knoydart so that we
can use all our connections to the Internet for both speed and
reliability.


So that's the Tegola story to date. As described on our [home page] we
are helping, directly or indirectly, quite a large number of community
broadband projects in Scotland. The research continues, but the
community aspect of the activity has now been taken over by [HUBS] for
which we have funding from the [Carnegie Trust], and the news is even
more promising:  Scottish Government is announcing a [community
broadband] support scheme, and we hope to work with them.

But, just in case you think that the story has a completely happy
ending, please remember that the main issue has been  getting our
backhaul.  We have been moderately lucky; but for much of Scotland the
necessary infrastructure is lacking, and until that infrastructure is in place,
community networks will not realise their full potential.
