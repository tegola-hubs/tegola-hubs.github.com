A Brief History Tegola Project
==============================

The Tegola project started in 2007 when a group of academics from the
[University of Edinburgh] decided to start up a research project on the
delivery of reliable, high speed broadband in rural areas.  It is
entirely uncoincidental that one of the members of this group has a
house in a village that was then without broadband.

In November 2007, the group, together with some colleagues erected a
link from [Isleornsay] to [Corran], a distance of about 10 miles, and for
one glorious weekend, thanks to a resident of Isle Ornsay who let us
use his Internet connection, brought broadband to a couple of houses
in Arnisdale and Corran.  Alas, we could not keep that connection, and
at that time the Scottish Government was unwilling to help us obtain
one.

Fortunately, because it was a research project, we were able -- thanks
to help from the [University of the Highlands and Islands] and from 
[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig], we were able to obtain a connection to the
Internet via the academic network [Janet].  Although this was great
for our research because Janet could offer much higher speeds than
anything that was available to domestic consumers, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig
was not in an ideal position.  It is further away from Corran (over 13
miles) and there is no line-of-sight for wireless transmission.  In
fact the lowest point that can "see" both Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and Corran
is over 300m up the side of [Beinn Sgritheall], and not an easy walk.
Amazingly one afternoon in very early January, a group of about eight
residents of Arnisdale and Corran, all somewhat the worse for wear
from [Hogmanay] celebrations turned out and in, the space of a few hours,
climbed the hill and erected our first relay.  It was then that we
realised that community involvement was essential to the project.

By the summer of 2008 we had completed the research testbed, a ring of
five relays, and a number of research projects were started as
described on our [research pages].  Tegola was frequently [in the
news], though it failed to make an impact on Scottish Government. 

The next major event took place when we were approached by Simon
Helliwell on [Eigg]. The people on Eigg had been frustrated by various
attempts to get satellite connections from companies that went
belly-up.  Although the latest offering,  heavily
subsidised  by the Government, looked as though it would be more
stable, the performance was so bad that they turned to us for help. 
We lent them some equipment and rapidly erected a test link, which
performed perfectly. We had hoped that, just as Tegola was
getting its connection through an educational network, that Eigg could
get its connection through another educational network, [Pathfinder],
through [Mallaig High School].
Unfortunately [Highland Council], which one might think would more
commitment than universities to providing for local communities, did
not see it this way, and the Small Isles had to make do with a bunch of BT lines
in Arisaig -- not nearly as good as what Tegola was getting, but much
better than their satellite connection.  For more detail on this see
the [Hebnet] Web site.


By the middle of 2011 it was clear that we could use our research
projects as a reason for providing backhaul to what was now a
successful community network.  We either had to formalise our
arrangement with Janet or, like Hebnet, fall back on relatively slow
BT lines, which would be a pity because our networks are capable of
delivering speeds that are well above the best domestic speeds that
are available in the UK.

Fortunately, there were a number of happy coincidences.  First, Janet
started to modify its rules to give Universities more freedom in what
they could do with their Internet backbone;  second UHI said that it
would be willing to obtain extra backhaul for us on a permanent basis;
and third Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, which had always been very supportive,
gave us a "wall" on which we could mount antennae. The catch was that
we would have to reimburse UHI for what they were paying for the
increased bandwidth, and in that part of the world, bandwidth is not
cheap.  Fortunately [Marine Harvest], a company with at least two
stations in the general Tegola/Hebnet region stepped in to subsidise
the added capacity.  This is an ideal example of industry-community
collaboration: each side needs the other. We are now combining the
Tegola and Hebnet networks, together with South Knoydart so that we
can use all our connections to the Internet for both speed and
reliability. 

So that's the Tegola story to date. As described on our [home page] we
are helping, directly or indirectly, quite a large number of community
broadband projects in Scotland. The research continues, but the
community aspect of the activity has now been taken over by [HUBS] for
which we have funding from the [Carnegie Trust], and the news is even
more promising:  Scottish Government is announcing a community
broadband support scheme, and we hope to work with them.

But, just in case you think that the story has a completely happy
ending, please remember that the main issue has been  getting our
backhaul.  We have been moderately lucky; but for much of Scotland the
infrastructure is lacking, and until that infrastructure is in place,
community networks will not realise their potential.
