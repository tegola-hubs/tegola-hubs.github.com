Trivia
======

In this page we gather some curiosity and figures about the project.

The name
--------

The codename "tegola" means "roof tile" in Italian. It reminds that in
the future there'll be a small intelligent brick on every roof...

Hear how it is pronounced ([ogg](/misc/tegola.ogg), [mp3](/misc/tegola.mp3)):

Mountains
---------

The highest mast of our testbed is situated on the shoulder of [Beinn
Sgritheall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beinn_Sgritheall) at an
altitude of 308m above sea level. It takes us more than an hour to
reach it, very often in severe weather conditions.  This is a good
motivation to write reliable code.
