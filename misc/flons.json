    "description": "The Tegola project started in 2007 when three of us, academics from the University of Edinburgh decided to start up a research project on the delivery of low-cost, reliable and high speed broadband in rural areas. It is entirely uncoincidental that one of us has a house in a remote village that was then without broadband. Tegola is a HUBS member and provides service throughout the Loch Hourn area."
