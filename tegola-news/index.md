Tegola in the news
==================

* In June 2008 The BBC did a programme on the Tegola project.  Here
   are some clips from it.

   * [The head of BT Scotland] pronounces Tegola "not robust". Since
   that programme was made, the downtime of Tegola on West Knoydart has
   been about 3 days;  BT telephones have been down for over 3
   weeks.

   * [Early speed tests].  We are now doing much better than 10Mb/s.

   * [The BBC itself uses Tegola]

* The Royal Society of Edinburgh's [Digital Scotland Report]. Tegola
  was one of the projects that motivated this report, which identified
  the lack of infrastructure as the main obstacle for high speed
  broadband in Scotland.

* Tegola wins the [2011 Nextgen Challenge] for Rural Leadership and
  Community development. Here is the [submission] for the award.

* A [Radio 4 interview] with Peter Mcmanus.  The relevant segment is [here](mcmanus-interview.mp3)
