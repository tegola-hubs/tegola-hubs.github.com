The Tegola / HUBS Project
=========================

HUBS or High-Speed Universal Broadband for Scotland is a joint
enterprise between the Universith of the Highlands and Islands, the
University of Edinburgh and the University of Stirling to assist with
the provision of high speed Internet access to communities in rural
areas in Scotland that would otherwise be unserviced. HUBS
accomplishes this by providing infrastructure support and technical
expertise to local community networks which are ultimately owned,
constructed and maintained by the communities themselves.

Tegola was the first such network, working with the Loch Hourn
Community Broadband Cooperative (CIC), built as a wireless network
covering the villages of [Arnisdale] and [Corran], North [Knoydart]
and [Isleornsay] on [Skye] and connected to the [janet] backbone at
[Sabhal Mòr Ostaig], the [UHI] college near [Armadale].

Tegola / HUBS has since worked with the [Knoydart Foundation] and
[Hebnet] to establish similar networks in South Knoydart and the
[Small Isles], respectively. Furthermore these three networks, being
physically adjacent are now interconnected and engineered so as to
provide mutual fail-over and redundancy in case of faults or
outages. The experience gained from doing this has enabled members of
the Small Isles communities to assist those in [Glenfinnan] and
[Applecross] and  Tegola / HUBS is also working with communities in
Lanarkshire, Stirlingshire and West Lothian to build their own
networks on a similar model.

In addition to assistance with the construction of these networks, it
is clear that the communities involved are individually too small to
have significant negotiating power to deal on a wholesale or carrier
level with major UK telecommunications operators. This is evident, for
example, in the West [Highland] and Small Isles network in that though
they have significant internal infrastructure and multiple Internet
connections, the networks are not yet multi-homed in the usual sense.
Tegola / HUBS is able to fill this gap by acting for these
communities collectively in their interactions with the Internet
registries and major carriers in order that they are able to build
truly world-class network infrastructure.

Finally, Tegola / HUBS operates an information resource which curates
the knowledge and know-how obtained from these endeavours and makes it
available so that others may learn from and build upon our
experiences.
