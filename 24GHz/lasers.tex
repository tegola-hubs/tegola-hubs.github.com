\label{sec:fso}

At the request of the Scottish Government we also evaluated an
unrelated technology for use in urban areas – free-space optics. This
means signalling by laser through the air instead of through
fibre-optic cabling. The main question here was, since these devices
operate in the visible spectrum, how well do they operate in reduced
visibility conditions? Do they operate well enough for use in this
climate over short distances. Again it is a question of cost. The
equipment is expensive (some \pounds 8-15k per link) and requires careful
mounting and alignment, but compared to the civil engineering cost of
running fibre in urban areas, or leasing it, it may be worth it.

The free-space optics equipment performs, as expected, well over
distances of a few hundred metres, but will not be useful for longer
links in a rural (Scottish) environment1. The equipment is expensive,
and beyond the reach of a small community project, though we might
have been able to reduce the cost by using an alternative vendor.

A link was established between TechCube and Appleton Tower, a distance
of 500m, and evaluated using routine HUBS traffic.

Installing the link was significantly more arduous than installing the
accompanying wireless link. It required on-site optical splicing to
bring the optical link to the server cabinets at each end-point, and a
dedicated high-current power supply.

It was also suggested that custom arrangements, more rigid than those
required for a wireless connection, would be required for a laser
link. In the event, we used some of our standard fixing arrangements
(bolting to a framework of alloy scaffold poles anchored to the
building at 3m intervals) for the Summerhall end of the link.

The purpose of the trials with the free-space optical (FSO) links was to
ascertain the extent to which fog, a common feature of the Scottish
environment especially in coastal areas, would affect their
use. Aerosolised water droplets attenuate visible and infrared
light. We can quantify this effect theoretically as we do in
\S\ref{sec:absorption} and \S\ref{sec:scattering}, but we were
primarily interested in finding out if their operational window was,
on average, large enough to justify the considerable expense.

\subsection{Link Design}
\label{sec:link-design}

CableFree, the laser vendor produced a link design as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:cablefree-link}. In principle it is plausible,
consisting of a laser link, and a back-up radio link between Appleton
Tower and the Tech Cube, a distance of about 500m. At either end two
switches would use the spanning-tree protocol (STP) configured with the
radio link having a higher cost than the laser link. The principle
being that traffic would flow over the lasers unless they were
unavailable in which case the backup link would be used.

  \caption{CableFree Link Design}
  \label{fig:cablefree-link}
\end{figure}

There were, however, several problems with this design. The less
serious was that this design was hardly appropriate for the local
environment. We already had a significant amount of radio equipment at
both sites -- including a radio link between them -- so an extra radio
link was superfluous. The radios specified by the vendor were low-end
Mikrotik radios with panel antennae in a waterproof enclosure. This is
not to cast aspersions on Mikrotik equipment, indeed we make much use
of it and it is generally quite good for the price. However Cablefree
wished to sell this re-branded equipment at a significant markup.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=0.3\textwidth]{also-faulty}
\end{wrapfigure}
Most amusingly, the mounting brackets supplied with the re-branded
Mikrotik radios were somewhat flimsy. It can get very windy at the top
of tall buildings in Edinburgh. Wind speeds can reach several times
more than at ground level. The installation is shown at right with the
mounting bracket having worked loose in high winds leaving the radio
pointing downwards.

We also had high end HP ProCurve J9050A switches at either end (loaned
by the School of Informatics), far more capable network elements than
the consumer-grade Netgear switches (see
Figure~\ref{fig:carrier-grade}) specified by the vendor. The
deficiencies of the Netgear switch are that it is not manageable via
telnet or ssh, which makes it very difficult to recover from outages
or erroneous configurations in a network of any size or complexity,
and more seriously, the cheap power adapter of the kind that are prone
to failure or simply disconnection due to the use of barrel
connectors. The power injector for the re-branded Mikrotik radio also
suffers from this deficiency (the white apparatus connected into the
switch in the photograph).

Unfortunately CableFree wished to sell a ``complete solution'' for us
to evaluate rather than an ``appropriate solution'' for our
circumstances and we succumbed to their hard-sell, ``complete'' with
sub-standard parts. We ultimately ended up operating the link by
connecting the vendor-supplied netgear switches to our HP switching
core and removing the vendor-supplied radio equipment entirely.

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{carrier-grade}

  \caption{A ``carrier-grade'' ethernet switch.}
  \label{fig:carrier-grade}
\end{figure}

The more serious deficiency with this design is the use of the
spanning-tree protocol. We will have more to say about the detail of
this below, but in brief, the mechanism is unstable in marginal
conditions. If the weather is clear or if the weather is very foggy,
the link operates as designed. However in the region between clear and
very foggy, the path is liable to rapidly change between the (possibly
unuseable) optical link and the radio link. Evidence for this is
anectodal due to the impossibility of properly instrumenting the
optical equipment, of which also more below.

\subsection{Installation}
\label{sec:fittings}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}
  \includegraphics[angle=-90,width=0.3\textwidth]{tada}
\end{wrapfigure}
Two different methodologies were used for the physical
installation. At Appleton Tower we were not permitted to make any
permanent modifications to the building. The laser head was therefore
mounted on a pedestal, shown at right. This was fixed to a paving tile
and further weighed down with more scrap paving tiles to prevent it
from blowing away.

Installation at the Summerhall site was straightforward since we were
able to make building modifications. We used aluminium scaffolding to
create a frame fixed to the side of the plant room on the roof and
fixed the laser head to that.

Alignment of the lasers was straightforward -- in fact easier than
anticipated and though it was done with specialised equipment (which
measures signal strength and produces audible faster or slower beeps
accordingly as the optical link is well or poorly aligned) it appears
to be quite possible to align the link without any more equipment than
a simple two-way radio. This is done by observing the beam edges on
one end (after a rough alignment) and instructing a colleague over the
radio to slightly move the far laser until the edges are centered with
respect to the near one, and repeating the procedure for the other
side. This turned out to be necessary as severe winds caused the
Appleton Tower pedestal-mounted end to de-align.

We also had to make some modifications to the lasers due to poor
design. A protective piece of glass that covers the lens had to be
fixed with screws because it came off easily. Luckily we found this,
to our surprise, in the workshop before installing the equipment.

\subsection{Absorption of light by water}
\label{sec:absorption}

Unlike electromagnetic waves at radio frequencies which are not
significantly attenuated by atmospheric gasses, in the visible and
near-infrared part of the spectrum this effect plays a major role. We
all know from our experience that this is the case, for example this
effect explains why objects under water take on a blue-green tinge --
because the red part of the light reflected from them is attenuated
more by water than blue or green light. In fact we have data for this
which is shown plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:absorption-liquid} which
ranges over wavelengths from the ultraviolet (circa 380nm) to the
near-infrared (circa 800nm).

    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Absorption of light by frequency through liquid water
    (\cite{jonasz_absorption_2007})}
  \label{fig:absorption-liquid}
\end{figure}

A line is marked on the diagram that shows the particular wavelength
of interest for the free-space optical equipment, 780nm. This
corresponds to an absorption coefficient of around 2.65/m$^{-1}$ which
means that through liquid water, light at this wavelength decreases in
intensity by 2.65 times for every meter of water that it travels
through.

We are not, however, intending to operate this equipment under
water. Instead we are interested in water vapour in the form of clouds
or fog, so we need to figure out how much water vapour is contained
in a given amount of air when a cloud is present. We will take cloud
formation to mean (greater than) 100\% relative humidity. This means
that the vapour pressure of water in the air is greater than the
equilibrium vapour pressure at which it evaporates and condenses at
equal rates. In fact it condenses faster than it evaporates and so the
air becomes full of condensed water droplets, or in other words a
cloud forms. The formula for this pressure commonly used in the
literature is given by~\cite{buck_new_1981} as,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:buck}
  e_w = (1.0007 + 3.46\times 10^{-6}P)\times 6.1121e^{\frac{17.502T}{240.97+T}}
\end{equation}
with the pressure $P$ given in hPa and the temperature in
$^\circ$C. This relation is plotted in figure~\ref{fig:water-pressure}
for a pressure of one atmosphere (1013.25 hPa).
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[
      ymin=0, ymax=80,
      xmin=0, xmax=40,
      xlabel={Temperature $^{\circ}\text{C}$},
      ylabel={Equilibrium water vapour pressure hPa}
      ]
      \addplot[blue,domain=0:40, samples=40]
              { (1.0007 +
                3.46e-6*1013.25)*6.1121*exp(17.502*x/(240.97+x)) };
    \end{axis}
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Water vapour density as a function of pressure}
  \label{fig:water-pressure}
\end{figure}

Since this is the minimum water vapour pressure required to form a
cloud, we may use this as an estimate of the amount of water in the
air. At 10$^\circ$C, Buck's relation gives an equilibrium pressure of
1.23 kPa. Recalling our ideal gas law from high school,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ideal-gas}
  PV = nRT
\end{equation}
we can work out that,
\begin{equation*}
  n = \frac{PV}{RT} 
    = \frac{1.23\times 10^3 \times 1}
           {8.314 \times 283}
    = 0.528\, \text{mol}
\end{equation*}
we can look up the molar mass of water, which is
18.02$\text{g}/\text{mol}$, and so arrive at a density of water in the
cloud as it is forming of 9.01$\text{g}/\text{m}^3$.

So what? Well, we know that, roughly, liquid water has a density of
1$\text{g}/\text{cm}^3$ and in terms of cubic meters this is
$10^6\text{g}/\text{m}^3$. So this tells us that we should scale the
absorption factor for water by $9.01\times 10^{-6}$ at the point of
cloud formation, which gives an adjusted absorption factor of
$2.39\times 10^{-5}$. Over the course of our 500m path, this means
that loss due to absorption (heating of the cloud) is only about
1\%.

In practice, this value is an overestimate, owing primarily to the
fact that water vapour does not behave as an ideal gas near the phase
transition from vapour to water (condensation). Experimental
measurements (\cite{whiteman_cloud_1999}) and more sophisticated
models (\cite{tampieri_size_1976,hess_optical_1998}) give values a
couple of orders of magnitude lower for the density of water in
fog. We therefore conclude that absorption is not a significant factor
in attenuation of the signal from the lasers by fog.

\subsection{Scattering of light by water}
\label{sec:scattering}
Another possible effect on the light of the lasers by water droplets
suspended in the air is scattering, as the light is reflected in
random directions by the drops. There are various models for how
scattering happens depending on the relative dimensions of the
scattering objects (e.g. water droplets) and the wavelength of the
light concerned. Where the size of the object is large with respect to
the wavelength of light, the geometric properties of the object can be
used -- treating the object essentially like a partially silvered
mirror with some part of the ray refracting and some part reflecting
according to the index of refraction for the material. If the objects
are very small with respect to the size of a wavelength, Rayleigh
scattering can be used as an approximation to the
behaviour. Unfortunately with aerosols such as fog, neither of these
techniques can be used because the water droplets are comparable to
the size of a wavelength.

The technique which remains is to explicitly model the system of many
water droplets and to calculate their effect on the light using
Maxwell's equations. This is known as the Lorenz-Mie solution. We will
not do this either but instead show probabilistically how much light
makes it through a moderately thick fog over a distance of 500 meters.

From this, we can find out the attenuation do to a moderate fog, which
is,
\begin{align}
  \lambda &= 10^{\frac{\alpha}{10}}\\
  \alpha &= 10\log\lambda \approx 0.017 \text{dB}/\text{m}
  \label{eq:fog_attenuation}
\end{align}

This shows that with evenly distributed, moderately thick fog it can
be expected that the loss over a distance of 500m is nearly 9dB or a
signal weakened by about a factor of 8.

\subsection{Instrumentation}

The laser and wireless links were instrumented using standard port
statistics on the HP switches, collected in the usual way at five
minute intervals. It would have been interesting to be able to collect
more detailed information about the link -- signal strength, bit-error
rate and so forth -- but this was not possible as the vendor required
executing a non-disclosure agreement in order to be able to know how to
read this basic information and this would have prevented
dissemination of these results.

The port statistics are stored in the industry-standard Round-Robin
Archive format.

\subsection{Correlation of link operation with weather}
\label{sec:weather}

We have been monitoring availability of the optical link and we have
access to the UK hourly weather data for the purposes of this project
(1.4 GB for 2014, so far only 79 MB for 2014, which is just
January). Unfortunately we had to undertake some emergency works in
November to make way for Vodaphone at Summerhall, and it turns out
that this has interfered with some of our data-collection.

  \caption{Laser}
  \label{fig:throughput_laser}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:throughput_laser} shows the daily throughput in either
direction of the laser link over an eight-month period (blue and green
curves). The daily volume of traffic grows fairly steadily over the
eight-month period. These curves are overlaid on the hourly record of
visibility at Gogarburn (the closest MIDAS station for which hourly
visibility records are available), for reasons that will soon be made
clear.

The weather data shows no correlation between wind-speed and quality
of the FSO connection. The beam was observed to have an effective
spread of around 2m (diameter) over the 500m distance (around 13’ of
arc) and it was relatively straightforward to establish a functional
alignment, which was maintained without further intervention over the
course of this experiment. However, we did observe, as anticipated,
that the FSO link became effectively inoperative in conditions of
severely reduced visibility.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/fig2-Wireless-12-Apr-12-Nov}
  \caption{Wireless}
  \label{fig:throughput_wireless}
\end{figure}
The radio link is required to maintain service when the FSO is
inoperative. It comes into play automatically when FSO performance is
degraded to such an extent that the radio link is better. Figure 2
shows the daily throughput of the radio link, again overlaid on
visibility data.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/fig3-Wireless-28-March-1-June}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/fig4-Wireless-14-July-14-Aug}
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{results/fig5-Wireless-September}
  \caption{Detail}
  \label{fig:throughput_detail}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:throughput_detail} show portions of this period in
more detail. They show that use of the radio link is directly
correlated with episodes of low visibility (below 500m). Going back to
figure 1 we see that many of these episodes are short-lived, and have
little effect on the overall daily volume of traffic, but that in some
cases the fog is more persistent.

To quantify the likely impact of these climatic effects in any
proposed location, it would be useful to study both the frequency and
the duration of local episodes of low visibility. Longer episodes will
have greater impact in many applications.

We also note that longer links will clearly be more susceptible to
such effects. For example, over the course of 2014, only 10\% of hourly
observations at Gogarburn recorded a visibility of 500m or less, while
the figures for limits of 1km, 1.5km, and 2km are 10\%, 18\% and 44\%
respectively.

Unfortunately, as mentioned above, we were unable to monitor the
performance of the FSO link directly because of the proprietary
protocol that prevented adequate instrumentation. Nevertheless, we
were able to quantify the difference in performance between the laser
link and a back-up wireless link running over 5GHz unlicensed
spectrum. The FSO link has several times the bandwidth of the radio
link, but it is more susceptible to climatic degradation.
