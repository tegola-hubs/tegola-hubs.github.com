\section{Summary}
The Demonstrating Digital Programme of Scottish Government provided a small grant to the
University of Edinburgh to test wireless equipment that may be useful in the
deployment of rural community broadband.  Although most community
networks are currently limited not by the speed of their wireless
links, but by the available bandwidth, it is to be hoped that this
will be improved with the current....

A manufacturer of low-cost wireless distribution hardware has recently
released some low cost equipment operating in the 24GHz and 5GHz
spectrum.  If it lives up to its specifications, it offers an order of
magnitude increase in the capacity of current point-to-point links
over existing technology that operates in the spectra that are
available to com
munites.  In addition we tested laser (free-space
optics) equipment operating in an urban environment but also serving
rural communities.

To summarise our findings.
\begin{itemize}
\item The 24 GHz equipment could prove useful over relatively short
distances (up to 8 km) if licencing permitted use at the power for
which it is designed.

\item Given the current power limits and available bands in the 
5GHz range, the 5GHz equipment probably provides only a minor
improvement on what could be achieved by using two or three parallel
links using lower cost equipment in different bands.  There is, of
course, a simplicity/redundancy trade-off. Moreover the 5GHz equipment
was sensitive to tidal fading and occasionally failed completely (perhaps
due to the presence of marine radar)

\item The free-space optics equipment performs, as expected, well over
  distances of a few hundred metres, but will not be useful for longer
  links in a rural (Scottish)
  environment\footnote{Figure~\ref{fig-cloudy} shows the ``free-space''
    conditions on one of the shortest Tegola links.  The camera is at one relay
    and the next relay is about 2km away on the hill in the
    background.}. The equipment is expensive, and beyond the reach of
  a small community project, though we might have   been able to
  reduce the cost by using an alternative vendor.
\end{itemize}

The main obstacle to using the 5 and 24 GHz equipment is licencing.
Under current regulations the 24GHz is effectively useless, and the 5GHz
equipment would be much more useful if (a)  the power limits were to
be raised and (b) Ofcom were to publish their database of licences in
the C band.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
Many community broadband projects require a long-range wireless link
for their connection to the Internet. The equipment of choice is
currently based on wifi operating in the unlicensed 2.4 or 5GHz
spectra. This is cheap: the equipment for a long-distance
point-to-point link costs under \pounds 400 and can provide
bi-directional throughput of about 50Mb/s. While this provides an
improvement for the many rural communities that are served by long
copper telephone lines, 50Mb/s is no longer adequate for a community
of, say, 50 residences. Technically, there is no problem in getting
more bandwidth in one of the licenced spectra, but the equipment is
more expensive and the additional cost of the licence makes this
option unaffordable for small communities.

Recently some new equipment operating at 24GHz has come on the market
from Ubiquiti\footnote{\href{http://www.ubnt.com/airfiber}{\url{http://www.ubnt.com/airfiber}}}.
This is advertised as offering 1.4Gb/s at up to 13km. Although not as
cheap (a point-to-point link costs about \pounds 3,000) it might present
an opportunity for some rural communities to upgrade their service to
be competitive with the current fibre based offerings in the UK,
assuming they can find an internet connection with that bandwidth. A
5GHz variant is also produced by Ubiquiti claiming comparable speeds
at upwards of 50km.

With this in mind, the Scottish Government's Demonstrating
Digital programme provided the University of Edinburgh with funds to
test this equipment ``in the wild''. Of course, there is ample evidence
that the equipment works, but most of the evidence we have is
from installations in urban areas over short distances. How will
it perform over longer distances in West Highland weather? And what
are the practical problems faced by communities who want to install it?

At the request of the Scottish Government we also evaluated an
unrelated technology for use in urban areas -- free-space optics. This
means signalling by laser through the air instead of through
fibre-optic cabling. The main question here was, since these devices
operate in the visible spectrum, how well do they operate in reduced
visibility conditions? Do they operate \emph{well enough} for use in
this climate over short distances. Again it is a question of cost. The
equipment is expensive (some \pounds 8-15k per link) and requires
careful mounting and alignment, but compared to the civil engineering
cost of running fibre in urban areas, or leasing it, it may be worth
it.
