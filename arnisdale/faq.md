Arnisdale fibre questions -- frequently asked and otherwise
===========================================================

Why are we doing this?
----------------------

More precisely: why don't we stay with Nanostations?

First, although we are still getting good speeds, the world is
catching up, and I assume we want to stay ahead of the game.  Many of
you are already placing demands on the system (data rate and download
volumes) that are well above the national average.  This demand will
surely increase.

Because we are operating in an unlicensed part of the spectrum, a lot
of other electronic equipment (e.g. wireless routers) which 
operate at similar frequencies is starting to interfere with the
network. In five years, Arnisdale has gone from (wireless) silence to
an extremely noisy place.  We could fix this by replacing the
Nanostations with more advanced equipment operating at a different
frequency, but why not spend the money on fibre -- which gives us a
lasting solution?

Why didn't we lay fibre in the first place?
-------------------------------------------
Because we could not have afforded it.  Now, thanks  to
help from Marine Harvest, Sabhal MÃ²r Ostaig and the University of
Highlands and Islands, the subscriptions have accumulated to the point
that we can at least make a start on a fibre network.
