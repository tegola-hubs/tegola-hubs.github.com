HIE investment in fibre infrastructure for the Highlands
========================================================

Several people have asked us about the details of HIE's investment in Fibre Infrastructure for the Highlands and Islands.  There has been a [recent announcement] by HIE of a Â£146 million contract with BT.  As yet we have very few details

* There is a map

* We have heard, informally, that bandwidth will be available at these POPs at the same price that it is in urban areas of the UK.  If so, this is good news for some residents of the Highland and Islands.
