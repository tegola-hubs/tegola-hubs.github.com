<h1> Community Broadband Scotland – First Steps Workshop  </h1>

Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, October 12-13, 2012 sponsored by the Scottish Government,  Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and The University of Edinburgh.

<p/>
Dear Colleague,

<p/>
The Scottish Government, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and The University of Edinburgh would like to invite you to the Community Broadband Scotland – First steps workshop which will be held on the 12th and 13th October at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, Sleat, Isle of Skye, IV44 8RQ.  

<p/>
Digital connectivity is essential for rural communities, which are remote from services, socially dispersed and often deficient in other forms of communication.  Yet with current market forces, they are often last in line to receive it. Enabling these communities and small businesses to develop tailored solutions to meet their local broadband requirements can deliver significant benefits – increasing the pace of change, while trialling new technologies, solutions and business models. 

<p/>
As an example, the Tegola project was initiated 5 years ago by the University of Edinburgh, with support from Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and The University of the Highlands and Islands for research into the delivery of high-quality rural broadband. One of the by-products of this research is the demonstration that communities can build their own affordable distribution networks where centralised organisations cannot.  Tegola has spawned similar community networks in adjacent areas around Skye and has assisted in other projects around Scotland.  It has transformed the lives of hundreds of people living in remote areas of Scotland.

<p/>
Recognising that 10-15% of Scotland will not benefit from the Scottish Government’s Step Change Programme for next generation broadband infrastructure, the Scottish Government have launched Community Broadband Scotland which will enable rural communities to take greater ownership and play a central role in the provision of faster broadband services which will provide significant benefits to local and rural economies.

<p/>
The purpose of this event is to bring together these communities to promote learning based on best practice examples with industry, local government, community organisations and others to learn and be inspired from communities who have successfully deployed community broadband initiatives and to discuss potential solutions (technical and financial) with government, industry and other partners.

<p/>
