Thanks
======

One of the great things about small communities is how willing people
are to do things for mutual benefit. We have had a huge amount of help
with erecting masts and climbing onto rooftops.  Here we'd like to
thank a few people and organisations who have provided their help
without standing to benefit directly from the project.

* The people at [Sablhal Mòr Ostaig](http://www.smo.uhi.ac.uk/),
  especially Màrtainn Dòmhnallach and Charles Culbertson, who have
  helped a lot with keeping our system up and running.  

* Neil Hammond of [Chillwind Ltd.](http://www.chillwind.co.uk) who has
  provided us with advice and material for building masts. 

* Neil Robertson of Duisdalemore, who provided us with a testbed for
  our first experiments.
